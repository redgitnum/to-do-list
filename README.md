## TO DO LIST

### intro

One of the first things I did in react, not very complex but made me realize how react works and how much cleaner (at the time of coding) the code looks compared to plain JS coding. 

### overview

Looking back at this project I know it could look even better but I keep it like this to remember how I started.

* START
  * App starts with checking the cookies using universal-cookie plugin and either shows them or starts a blank list,
  * cookies save the list of tasks but not the completion state
* ADD
  * On pushing the button ADD or pressing enter key you add the item given in the input on the left,
  * If the item is already on the list, you will get a prompt with a message "already on the list" without adding the duplicate.
* COMPLETE
  * On clicking the complete sign you mark the task as complete (it is however pure cosmetic)
* DELETE
  * On clicking the X sign you delete the task (from the list in the state)
