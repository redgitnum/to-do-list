One of the first things I did in react, not very complex but made me realize how react works and how much cleaner (at the time of coding) the code looks compared to plain JS coding.

Looking back at this project I know it could look even better but I keep it like this to remember how I started.

  #### start
  App starts with checking the cookies using universal-cookie plugin and either shows them or starts a blank list.
